Usefull links to learn programming


The way to stand as a software engineer is very hard and has a lot of steps, but we walk through this path and we will get it! 

Studying this hard craft is easier with Google because without searching for information on the Internet by yourself, you will never get a good skill and knowledge level.

Below i am sharing some useful links for learning technologies and programming languages.

The first link is my GitHub's link. Firstly you can check the information about my projects. GitHub is an important part of your code way. This place helps you to store your projects and do development with other software engineers:

The next link is about my first programming course. This course was created by David J. Malan from Harvard University, and based on Harvard's study program. You can learn this course for free:

The third link is about a ton of useful articles about technologies and programming languages. I recommend you find articles about data structures:

It's time to check Programmer's Encyclopedia. You can find answers for all your questions, and ask TOP-engineers all questions connected with development:
